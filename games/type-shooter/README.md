# type-shooter
A typing game where words appear in balloons and you have to shoot them by typing the words.

This is one of my favorite games because it looks somewhat nice, still the text input is an eyesore, and I think there should be a timer or scoreboard. Also, more words should be added, maybe different diffiuclty modes. Random generated balloons would be interesting too to test your skills with string like "tofnno".
